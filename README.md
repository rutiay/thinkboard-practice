# 🧠 Think-Board (MERN Note-Taking App)

This is a simple **note-taking application** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes — a full CRUD app.

I developed this project by following a YouTube tutorial as part of my learning journey to strengthen my full-stack development skills. The app functions as a "think board", giving users a space to jot down thoughts, tasks, or ideas.
